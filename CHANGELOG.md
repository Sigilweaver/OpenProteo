# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `openproteo-io` 0.1.0 lib crate: vendor-feature gates (`thermo`,
  `bruker`, `waters`, `all`), `detect_format()` runtime probe, and
  `convert_to_mzml()` one-shot conversion that defers to the matching
  vendor crate.
- `openproteo-io-cli` 0.1.0 binary `vendor2mzml`: takes an input vendor
  path and an output mzML path, auto-detects the format, supports
  `--indexed`.
- End-to-end smoke test that converts Thermo / Bruker / Waters fixtures
  to mzML when present, skipping silently otherwise.
- `RENAME-TBD.md` flagging this as the working name pending the final
  decision (candidate: `OpenProteo`).
