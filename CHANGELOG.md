# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

- _No unreleased changes yet._

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-21

Maintenance release. Pins the stack at `openproteo-core = 1.0.0`,
`opentfraw = 1.0.6`, `opentimstdf = 1.0.6`, `openwraw = 1.0.5`. Raises
the workspace MSRV to 1.85 (required by transitive `arrow` 58.x).

### Changed

- Workspace `rust-version` bumped from `1.75` to `1.85`. CI MSRV job
  updated to match.
- All sibling-repo deps now resolve from crates.io. CI no longer
  multi-checks-out the vendor repos; cargo pulls them as ordinary
  registry crates.
- Docusaurus site moved from `docs-site/` to `docs/`. The legacy
  `docs/CORPUS.md` and `docs/RELEASE.md` notes were folded into
  inline docstrings and removed from the tree (see git history for
  the originals).
- Root `README.md` rewritten as a proper project landing page.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-18

First stable release of the OpenProteo umbrella. Pins the stack at
`openproteo-core = 0.1.0`, `opentfraw = 1.0.5`, `opentimstdf = 1.0.5`,
`openwraw = 1.0.4`. The library crate `openproteo-io = 1.0.0` is
published to crates.io; the `vendor2mzml` CLI ships as a binary
release artifact only.

### Added

- Shared corpus schema and fetcher (STRATEGY P3 #9). New
  `docs/CORPUS.md` documents the per-repo `sources.json` /
  `manifest.json` shape. New `scripts/fetch_corpus.py` is a
  vendor-agnostic port of OpenTFRaw's fetcher, parameterized by
  `--sources`, `--corpus-dir`, `--manifest`, and `--ext-pattern`.
  OpenTFRaw now wraps it via a small shim; OpenTDF and OpenWRaw
  carry stub `sources.json` files awaiting directory-bundle fetch
  support.
- README now leads with a stack callout naming the umbrella, the
  three vendor readers (`opentfraw`, `opentimstdf`, `openwraw`),
  shared core `openproteo-core`, and downstream consumer ProLance.
- ProLance truth-test gate. New `scripts/truthtest-prolance.sh` runs
  `cargo build --workspace` and `cargo test --features vendors` (and
  optionally `--with-corpus` for the full mzML -> Lance roundtrip) in
  the sibling ProLance checkout. `scripts/release-stack.sh` gains
  `--gate-prolance` and `--gate-with-corpus` flags that invoke the
  gate before tagging the umbrella; a non-zero exit aborts tag
  creation. Documented in `docs/RELEASE.md`.
- Typed `openproteo_io::Error` enum with `thiserror`-based variants
  (`UnsupportedFormat`, `FeatureDisabled`, `Io`, `Core`, feature-gated
  `Thermo`/`Bruker`/`Waters`, `Mzml`). Replaces `Box<dyn Error>` in
  `convert_to_mzml`, `convert_to_mzml_writer`, `collect`, and internal
  helpers. `openproteo-io-cli::mzml_reader` and `openproteo-io-py`'s
  internal helpers now use the same `openproteo_io::Result` alias.
- Coordinated stack release scheme. `scripts/release-stack.sh` reads
  pinned versions across the five-repo stack, aggregates per-repo
  `CHANGELOG.md` entries into combined release notes, and can create +
  push an annotated SemVer tag on the umbrella (dry-run by default;
  `--apply` gates all mutations).
- `STACK.md` pin-table snapshot of the current stack versions.
- `docs/RELEASE.md` documenting the umbrella SemVer tag scheme,
  per-repo bump rules, and the release procedure.
- `openproteo-io` 0.1.0 lib crate: vendor-feature gates (`thermo`,
  `bruker`, `waters`, `all`), `detect_format()` runtime probe, and
  `convert_to_mzml()` one-shot conversion that defers to the matching
  vendor crate.
- `openproteo-io-cli` 0.1.0 binary `vendor2mzml`: takes an input vendor
  path and an output mzML path, auto-detects the format, supports
  `--indexed`.
- End-to-end smoke test that converts Thermo / Bruker / Waters fixtures
  to mzML when present, skipping silently otherwise.
- `RENAME-TBD.md` flagging this as the working name pending the final
  decision (candidate: `OpenProteo`).

### Fixed

- Silenced unused-import warning for `openproteo_core::SpectrumSource`
  inside `openproteo_io::collect()` when no vendor features are
  enabled.

### Notes

- STRATEGY P0 #1 (route ProLance through `openproteo-io`) marked DONE.
  Shipped in ProLance `develop` commits `aece8f6` (single vendor
  ingester via `openproteo_io::collect`) and `708dbc3` (mzML writer
  delegates to `openproteo-core`).
- STRATEGY P3 #11 (ProLance integration tests as the stack truth test)
  marked DONE via the new `--gate-prolance` flag.
- STRATEGY P1 #3 rewritten and marked DONE: docs unification is
  rejected in favor of cross-linking. Each repo keeps independent
  docs to preserve legal isolation across the reverse-engineered
  parsers and to keep parser-specific docs unmuddied by umbrella
  scope. Stack callouts now live in all five stack repos plus the
  downstream ProLance consumer.
- STRATEGY P3 #9 (shared corpus + manifest) marked DONE: schema and
  fetcher shipped; actual corpus files remain per-repo and
  out-of-tree.
