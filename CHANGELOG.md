All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Coordinated stack release scheme. `scripts/release-stack.sh` reads
  pinned versions across the five-repo stack, aggregates per-repo
  `CHANGELOG.md` entries into combined release notes, and can create +
  push an annotated SemVer tag on the umbrella (dry-run by default;
  `--apply` gates all mutations).
- `STACK.md` pin-table snapshot of the current stack versions.
- `docs/RELEASE.md` documenting the umbrella SemVer tag scheme,
  per-repo bump rules, and the release procedure.
- `openproteo-io` 0.1.0 lib crate: vendor-feature gates (`thermo`,
  `bruker`, `waters`, `all`), `detect_format()` runtime probe, and
  `convert_to_mzml()` one-shot conversion that defers to the matching
  vendor crate.
- `openproteo-io-cli` 0.1.0 binary `vendor2mzml`: takes an input vendor
  path and an output mzML path, auto-detects the format, supports
  `--indexed`.
- End-to-end smoke test that converts Thermo / Bruker / Waters fixtures
  to mzML when present, skipping silently otherwise.
- `RENAME-TBD.md` flagging this as the working name pending the final
  decision (candidate: `OpenProteo`).
